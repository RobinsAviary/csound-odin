# csound-odin
Odin bindings for csound (WIP)

This repo is licensed under the same license as [csound's](https://github.com/csound/csound/?tab=LGPL-2.1-1-ov-file#readme).

The compiled version of csound in the repo is 6.18, and unless there are API changes, it should be fairly easy to switch out for updates.
